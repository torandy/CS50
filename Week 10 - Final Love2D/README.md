This is a memory game where the object of the game is to correctly repeat the sequence played by the computer.

1) A user is asked the # of rounds they wish to play.
2) Computer then generates a pattern based on the # of rounds inputted and then begins playing the sequence starting at 1.
3) User is then asked to play back the same sequence.
4) The game ends when either the user misplayed the sequence or when the user succesfully plays the sequence up to # of rounds inputted.
5) There is an option to replay the game at the end of the game.
