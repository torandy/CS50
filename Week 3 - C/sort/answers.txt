sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: It sorted the sorted50000 the fastest since it has best case Ω(n) (fastest of the 3 sorts)

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: Sorted random50000 the fastest amonst the rest since it has worst case O(n log n) (faster than Bubble and Selection sort)

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: It is the only remaining option, but we know that it has a best case of Ω(n²) which is slower than Bubble sort
